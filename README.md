First-Project
=============

This is 2012 project on "Impact of climate changes to small scale farmers in Mbeya region, Southern Highland-Tanzania"

ABSTRACT

Climate is the general weather condition prevailing in a given area for a long period. Kyela district is found in southern highland of Tanzania, district has warm and humid climate with mean daily temperature of 23ºc, and it has one season of rainfall and one season of dry weather and hot sun. The natural vegetation is of tropical savannah forests and grass with total population of 174,470 (83,342 male and 91,124 female). Main activities of residents of this area is agriculture which involve livestock keeping, and their major crops are rice, maize, cocoa, banana and they are good producers of palm oil which used in production of soap and cooking oil. They are also involved in business and fishing in lake Nyasa. Climatic changes taking place in this area have been leaving a lot people with many pains because many of them depend in rainfall agriculture due to fact that government have not constructed many irrigation schemes in the area.
But, farmers in Ipinda ward they have tried to fight with this climatic changes effects like drought and delay of rain fall season by engaged themselves in cultivation of crops along Rufilyo river and other small river like Ipinda river and Kisale river. This study have intended in finding out for how large farmers of Ipinda have been affected with changes in weather condition. This report is going show effects of changes in weather condition to small scale farmers by comparing amount of crops they harvest in last farming season as compared to previous years and by observing if poverty in this area is increasing or not as result of changes in climatic condition.

CHAPTER ONE
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Climatic change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years, it most affect small-scale famers because they are the one who depend much on weather condition as their main factor that determine their agriculture activities. In Tanzania country of more than 44 million of people, 80% of its people are farmers and most small-scale farmers, according to 2002 national population census. Southern parts of Tanzania produced almost half of all food crops that are needed in our country, and kyela district in mbeya region is one of that areas. Study in climatic change this areas is of much important for the growth of our economy and welfare of all living there.

1.2 BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM
The impact of climatic change to small-scale farmers has become the main issues in our country nowadays; government is trying to increase the standard of living of its people through introduction of various policies especially in agriculture. Many specialized experts have tried to conduct study on climatic change and came up with solution that have helped government in implementation of its policies. This research is intended on studying how these climatic changes have affected small-scale farmers and it has forced with some situation of climatic change that occurring in our country now days, which are:
•	Kilimanjaro glaciers and snow cover have been retreating (55 % of glacier loss between 1962 and 2000s).
•	Loss of clouds forests, since 1976 resulting in 25% annual reduction of water sources derived from fog.
•	Deep tropical lakes are experiencing because stronger stratification reduces upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water.



1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of climatic change to small-scale farmers in five village of Ipinda ward in Kyela district in southern highland of Tanzania. These villages include Kafundo, Ikulu, Kanga, Lupaso and Kisale.

1.4 OBJECTIVES
Objectives of this research are categorized as general and specific objectives, as follows:

1.4.1 GENERAL OBJECTIVES
The general objective of this study is to find out how small scale farmers have been affected with change of climatic condition; in general, I have dealt with farmers who depend much on weather condition for the growth of their crops.

1.4.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
Despite the above stated general objective, I have done study in order to cover the following areas:

1.4.2.1 Climatic Objectives
•	To study whether climatic change have affect amount of crops yield in last farming season as compared with other previous years by comparing what farmers have got in last season with what they used to get in previous seasons.
•	To study whether climatic changes have led farmers to add another means of life to depend on other than agriculture.
•	To study on whether small-scale farmers they know about government policies such as MKUKUTA and KILIMO KWANZA, and if they have any impact to them. 





1.4.2.2 Demographic and Social Objectives
•	To study whether there is positive relationship between poverty and number of household member.

1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY
This study has been carried out in five village of Kyela district in Mbeya region, I have chosen this village randomly and my study took almost three weeks from 6th to 26th of February in 2012. And it involves 50 household, 10 from each village.

1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY
Though I got strong cooperation from respondents and local government leader in accomplishment of this study, I had faced some unexpected challenge but thanks to VEOs for their assistance. Those challenges are as follows:
•	Fund limit: though HESLB have tried to cover up all costs of my study but it had still not enough, I had only given 42,000 for the whole study which is not enough even for fare from Dar es salaam to Ipinda-Kyela. Also I didn’t expect that I would face terrible situation in some household which will require my cash support.
•	Language barriers: during my preparation for the study I expected that I would face language problem because I do not know how to communicate by Nyakyusa language but what it had happen became more than what I expect.
•	Also I had face problem on what a appropriate time for data collection because most of household have been with no body at home during early hours of day. This became a problem during sun days when it has not been easy to collect data at noon hours.





CHAPTER TWO

2.1 LITERATURE REVIEW
Before doing my study on impacts of climatic changes to small scale farmers I have gone through some of literatures of different authors which somehow relate to my problem under study. Shardul Agrawala and Annett Moehmer in their report in development and climatic change in Tanzania. Focus on mountain Kilimanjaro, they have explained some of effects of climatic changes in northern part of Tanzania. Other literatures are “One UN pilot program in Tanzania”, study from January 2009 to June 2010, this is a joint program on environment with a focus on climatic change, land degradation/ desertification and natural resources management. It had achieved in production of eight policies brief on the impacts of climatic change on keys sectors. These documents were also be used throughout 2010 for the public awareness and to inform key decision makers in the country about the potential impacts of climatic change and climate variability on different sectors. 
Study on climatic change perceptions and adaption among rural population in the great Ruaha Basin by Emma Liwenga of institute of Resources Assessment (University of Dar es salaam), have explained why climatic change is a problem that needed to be study and appropriate measures to be taken. After reviewing all this literature, my study on impact of climatc change to small scale farmers is not something new.










CHAPTER THREE

3.1 RESEARCH METHODOLGY
3.1.1 RESEARCH TECHNIQUE
Technique involved in data collection for this study used both qualitative and quantitative technique, whereby i have used qualitative technique in data that cannot be measured like amount of rainfall they got in the last farming season and effects of a distance between their home and water source. And I have used quantitative technique in collection of data like amount of crops they yield in the last farming season, size of their farms and even the number of people in a household.

3.1.2 POPULATION OF THE STUDY
In this study, my targeted population was households in five villages of Ipinda ward in Kyela district of Mbeya region that depend much on small-scale agriculture and also mainly depend on whether condition for the growth of their crops.

3.1.3 SAMPLE SIZE
I my study on impact of climatic change to small-scale farmers in Kyela district, I have used a sample size of 50 household, that is 10 household from each village. I have decided to use sample size of 50 household in order for the data collected to be normally distributed and at least it will have some representatives of the population under study.

3.1.4 SAMPLING TECHNIQUE
Since in my sudy I can not attend all households in Kyela district, I have done a simple random sampling in order to get one ward out of 15 wards of kyela district, and again I have done another simple random sampling in order to get 5 villages out of 11 villages of Ipinda ward. I have decided to use simple random sampling because it is simple to use and this sampling of getting one wards out of 15 and 5 villages out of 11 it is not a big deal, compared with if I had decide to use another method of sampling.

3.1.5 DATA COLLECTIOIN METHOD
Data collection methods involved in this study are of using questionnaires that is interviews by using questionnaires because this method is simple and easy in administered. By this method, I have been able to control information that have been provided by respondents. That is, some respondent have been provide answers to two questions that relates by two answers, which contradict themselves. Again, I have use observation method in answering some of my study questions. Example: size of their farm that are found around their house and the amount crops they might get.
 
3.1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
In my study on impacts of climatic changes to small-scale farmers, I had intended in testing the following hypothesis;
1)	H0: Climatic changes have no impacts to small-scale farmers.
H1: Climatic changes have impacts to small-scale farmers.

2)	H0: There is independency between size of household and poverty level.
H1: There is no independency between size of household and poverty level.









CHAPTER FOUR

4. RESEARCH FINDING AND DATA ANALYSIS
4.1 RESEARCH FINDING
In this chapter, am going to discuss what I have been able to obtain in my study. In Kyela district, the impact of climatic change can be seen in the following areas.

4.1.1 AMOUNT OF CROPS YIELDS
 Ipinda ward is located in lowlands of Livingstone mountains, it had very fertile lands few years ago but now large parts of its land is of low fertile which produce a small amount of crops because of climatic changes. This results into a many problems because many of its residents depend on agriculture activities.  Example: let us check on amount of the following crops yields, which are the famous crops in the areas.

4.1.1.1 RICE
Farmers in ipinda ward they used to get almost 400 up to 500 tin of rice per acre during the years of 1990s up to early of 2000s years, but due to climatic changes like hot sun during farming season and change in rainfall season have led into decline in amount of crops yield. Example: during 2010-2011 farming season farmers they expect rain to start at the end November (2010) but unfortunately rain didn’t come till early of January (2011). Table 1 below show farms size of the 50 farmers with their respective amount of rice (in tin) they got in the last farming season.





TABLE 1
 
Table 1 above show size of farms and amount of rice corresponding t those sizes.

Now, from the table 1 above, we see that for the households who own farm size of 0-1 acres, only 3 households who succeeded to obtain more than 41 tin, which is almost 23.08%.

4.1.1.2 MAIZE
Effects of climatic changes can also seen in cultivation of maize because of changes in amount of maize yields. Farmers in Ipinda ward they used to get 250 up to 400 tin of maize per acre but now they get less than half of it, as table 2 suggest.

TABLE 2
 
Table 2 above show size of the farms with corresponding amount of maize obtained and the number of household.

From the table above we see that no household out of 50 households that succeed to maintain to harvest more than 25 tin per acres (average amount per one plot) in the last farming season.

4.1.1.3 COCOA
Cocoa is one of the crop that it has not been mush affected with climatic changes especially in Kyela district. Farmers in this area they used to get 250 up to 300 kilogram of cocoa per acre, normally cocoa grown in farm with many crops in it, such as banana, beans and cassava. Cocoa in recently years became leading cash crop in this area. Table three below show amount of cassava (in kg) and the size of farm grown in. 

TABLE 3
 
Table 3. show size of the farms and amount of cocoa harvested corresponding with number of household.

We see that, amount of cocoa obtained in the last farming season is not much varying from what farmers in this area used to harvest.

4.1.1.4 BANANA
Banana is another crop that is of much important and it is largely cultivated in Kyela district. Farmers in these areas cultivate this crops mainly for food but sometime they are forced to sell them in order to solve some of their financial problems. If we see table 4 below, we find that for households that engaged themselves in cultivation of this crop, they get bunchs of banana, which are sufficient only for their family uses.

TABLE 4
 
Table 4 above show size of the farms and bunch of banana yields with responding number of households.

4.1.1.5 OTHER CROPS
In households I have succeed to conduct my study, I have found that they cultivate other crops like groundnuts, beans and cassava in small amount and largely for family uses (food). These crops are good resistance of climatic change especially cassava because they can hold even if there is small amount of rainfall or even if there is delay in rain season.
















PIE CHART 1
 
Pie chart above show degrees of households that cultivate crops other than those mention above

From the pie chart above we find that19 households out of 50 households (that is 38.0%) they have not engaged in cultivation of these crops as compared to 31 households (62%) which have engaged in cultivation of these crops. Moreover, these household are the one, which are much suffering with poverty because they are forced to find another income from other source other than farming in order to buy these foods because they are needed almost daily.  

4.1.2 OTHER MEANS OF LIFE
Impact of climatic changes to small-scale farmers can also be seen in daily activities carried out by these small-scale farmers. We know that by a definition, a farmer is anybody who engaged himself/herself in farming activity as his/her main and only means of life. Farmers in Kyela district especially in Ipinda ward they have been engaged themselves in activity other than farming in order for them to survive. This happen because of unexpected changes in weather condition like delay in rain season and sometime inadequate rainfall.
Farmers in Ipinda they have opt to do activity like business such as opening small shops and production of local wines, livestock keeping which help them when they get milk and other dairy product from their livestock and see it. Other activities are like finding permanent job and sometime temporally job in order to earn money for their daily life. 

PIE CHART 2
 
Pie chart above show degrees of households who have decided to engaged in other activity other than agriculture and their activities.

From the above pie chart, we see that 36 percent (18 that is household) out of all 50 households have decided to adds other activity in their life in order to fight with climatic changes.






4.1.3 GOVERNMENT POLICY AND OTHER AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS

In order to rise the standard of living for their people and to increase their daily income government have a tendency of creating policies and starting development programs which in some areas their goals have been achieved. While in other areas, there is no achievement because of reasons like inadequate funds and in some areas there is poor management of project.

4.1.3.1 GOVERNMENT POLICIES
Government policies like KILIMO KWANZA (green revolution) that has formulated in 2009 it had intended in reducing poverty through modernized and commercialize agriculture, which will result into increases in the value of produced crops, increase the amount of crops harvested, and it has planned to reduce dependent on rainfall by construction of irrigation schemes. And by provision of subsidized agriculture inputs like fertilizers and seeds that can resists pests and diseases and that can grow in area with low amount of rainfall.

 4.1.3.2 OTHER AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The government of Tanzania has recently developed Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) and its operational program (ASDP), whose objectives are to achieve a sustained agricultural growth rate of 5% per annum, through the transformation from subsistence to commercial agriculture. 
The ASDP has five key components on which it seek improvement: (i) the policy, regulatory and institutional arrangements; (ii) agricultural services (research, advisory and technical services, and training); (iii) investment through DADP implementation; (iv) private sector development, market development, and agricultural finance, and (v) cross-cutting and cross-sectoral issues.

Despite of all these effort of government in increasing the standard of living of its people but many of people in Ipinda ward especially farmers they still don’t enjoy the fruits of these programs. Example, I have found that though government have tried to supply subsidized fertilizer but only few of farmers have been able to afford to contribute some money as government plan in order for them to get access to those fertilizer. And in many areas this became a chance to local leaders in collaboration with agents of this fertilizer to be very corrupt. Pie chart below show that only 10 households out of 50 households, that is 20% have been able to get fertilizer from the government (minjingu) in the last farming season. Moreover, other slices show that large number of households, which is 33 households (66%) they don’t know anything about KILIMO KWANZA policy and DADP and ASDP.

PIE CHART 3
 
Pie chart above show degree of households which have been able to get access to kilimo kwanza policy and other agricultural development program.






4.1.4 POVERTY
Poverty by definition is a state of being insufficient in amount and according to HDR (Human Development Report) of November 2011 it had reviled that poverty in many African country is an increasing phenomena. During my study I have found that many family are living under extremely poverty because of poor performance in the last farming seasons which results into a small amount of harvest. Also I have found that many households in Ipinda ward are not only experiencing income poverty but also many of them they are facing problems of lands for agriculture activities, which forced them to rent some piece of lands which are very expensive issue to them, that is one piece of land cost almost 50,000 up to 80,000 tshs.

4.2 DATA ANALYSIS
In testing the above stated hypothesis, in this section am going to show how we can be able to use chi-square test for independently to accept or reject the stated null hypothesis.

4.2.1 TEST ONE
Hypothesis
 H0: Climatic changes have no impacts to small-scale farmers
 H1: Climatic changes have impacts to small-scale farmers

Data given

4.2.2 TEST TWO
In this test, we are going to see if there is strong relationship between poverty level and the size of household as HDR of November 2011 by UNDP suggest.

Hypothesis
 H0: There is independency between size of household and poverty level
 H1: There is no independency between size of household and poverty level. 

Data given
Let;
 Row: size of household (independency variable)
 Column: annual income (non-independency variable)
Now:

 
 

 

 

 










CHAPTER FIVE

5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1 RECOMMENDATIONS
Climatic change and its impacts are sensitive issues that are needed to be addressed and serious measure to be taken against it. Despite government effort in reducing extremely poverty of its people but there are still no improvements on standard of living of people especially those living in rural areas, which many of them are small scale farmers and their farming depend on weather condition. 
I recommend that, government should increase its effort on eradicating poverty practically because what I can see is that we have good policies and programs but these things are written documents  only. Government budget of financial year 2011-2012 it somehow tried to put emphasis on it but budget allocated to agriculture sector is still low. African Union on one of its head of state annual meeting, they have agreed that, budget allocated to agriculture sector must not be less than 10% of all government budgets. Also I recommend that, government should make hurry in establishment of Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB) as one of KILIMO KWANZA policy strategy in reducing poverty because I believe that this bank will provide loans of small interest to small scale farmers. During my study I have met one farmer and his main cry is on financial assistance, he admitted that nowadays agriculture became very expensive and this result into many farmers failing in full participating in farming. Example; cost of preparation and maintaining one acres of rice is almost 200,000 tshs.
Again, I recommend that government must review it is system used in supplying subsidized fertilizer because the existence system gives a chance for unfaithful local leaders to take advantage of it, and also I recommend that government should provide 100% subsidization and not the current system of community contribution.




5.2 CONCLUSION

Climatic changes have many impacts to small-scale farmers, especially those farmers whose farming depend on weather condition. Ipinda ward have more than 16,756 people and 90% of them are small-scale farmers. In this area, government have succeeded to provide its people with clean and safe water, that is % of people have access to clean water from either KYEWASA or DANIDA which had helped them not to spend a lot of time in searching for water, hence they have enough time for farming activities. And, nearly % of its people have at least primary level education which it help them in practicing modernized and commercialized agriculture. I would like to congratulate government for that because it helped to reduce pains of climatic change to farmers.
